**Warning**
------------------
The code is provided as is, it is not of any quality and it consists mainly of mash ups of the examples provided by the part vendors.
Use it as your own risk. Also, I am only providing the files I modified. You will need to download all the dependencies and libraries
from the pages of the vendors.

MSG Cyberdeck
------------------

The MSG Cyberdeck `msglab.co/room/msg-background <https://msglab.co/room/msg-background>`_ is a deck with enough tricks under the hood to be your daily driver for computing,
hacking, learning and experimenting. Since it is a 3D printed DIY build, repairs and upgrades are core
to the MSG capabilities.

The MSG uses some Python to run the eInk screen, which displays the logo on top and a few stats on the bottom: Pi temperature, battery level, voltage and time.
It also uses a bit of code to run the MicroDot Phat. All the code can be found in the MSG Cyberdeck folder in this repo.

LoRa MSG
------------------

Official binaries for all supported boards are available through
`circuitpython.org/downloads <https://circuitpython.org/downloads>`_. The site includes stable, unstable and
continuous builds. Full release notes and assets are available through
`GitHub releases <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases>`_ as well.


Thanks for checking my Git!
I am a DIY hobbyist assembling cyberdecks and electronics on my spare time.
I do most of my project loogging on my site: <https://www.msglab.co>, but I plan on using this Git to share code I use to power some of my creations.
